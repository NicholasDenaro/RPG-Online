	If you continue East, you can fight slimes.
	In order to attack you must have AP, this regenerates over time based on your stamina.
	Remember, to target monsters, press V and press again to change target. Skills auto target monsters directly in front of you.

[tag=Skill]
{
	Here is a basic attack you can use to fight.
	You can find more skills by completing quests, or finding skill scrolls.[Skill=1]

	It seems you are new to this land.
	In order to help you begin your adventures, I am authorized to give you a quest.
	The quest is to kill some slimes in the zone to the east.
	What do you say?[Actions=Accept,Decline]

	If you wish to accept later, you may do so.
	[goto=Leave]
}
[tag=QuestInfo0]
{
	To complete the quest, kill 5 slimes and report back to me.
	If you don't already have the <<Punch>> skill, talk to me about skills.
	[goto=Leave]
}
[tag=FinishQuest0]
{
	It seems you were able to kill the slimes.
	It probably wasn't too difficult to kill the slimes, but take this heal.[Heal]
